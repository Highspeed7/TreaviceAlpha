<h2>Your Treasure Troves...</h2>
<p>These are your treasure troves, you will start out by defining a trove name to which you can add one or more 
    treasures or items to. You will notice that by default you have a treasure trove that contains your accumulated points.
    These points can also be divided up amongst troves to "sweetin' the pot" of any given collection.
